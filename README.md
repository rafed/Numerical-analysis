# Numerical-Analysis-in-C
Simple codes on root finding, differentiation, integration and linear systems

1. Root finding: Bisection method, Newton-Raphson's mehthod and false position method
2. Differentiation: forward, central and backward diferrential quotient used
3. Integration: Simpsons 1/3 rule, trapezoid rule
4. Linear systems: Jacobi's method, Gaussian method
